# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would add even more animations, probably to the illustrations we have on the main page. I would also add some cool fonts to make some of the sections a little more visually appealing. Potentially having a contact icon with fixed position so that customers could easily make a call or email the coffee shop.
